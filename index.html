        I'v been studying web development kind of loosely for the last 5 months,
        mostly through
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.com</a> and Brian
        Holt's
        <a href="https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/"
          >complete intro to web dev</a

        but I still feel like I need some way to level up my skills.

        This morning while browsing through reddit I read a very interesting
        comment for someone that feels stuck like me:

        So here we are. I'm making myself write this blog and document
        everything I'm learning and try to implement some kind of version of it
        on here or give out links.
      </p>
      <p>What do I know right now? Here is some <em>unordered list</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I know HTML and some CSS (yes I'm also talking about flexbox and
          grid). I've also gotten freeCodeCamp's
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/"
            >Responsive web design</a
          >
          certification.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can put up this repo on
          <a href="https://github.com/trubh/blog">GitHub</a> and make a Page out
          of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've almost finished freeCodeCamp's
          <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/"
            >JavaScript course</a
          >
          so I understand JS and can use at least the basics of it (I've linked
          this page to a .js file).
        </li>
        <li>
          I've learned basic SASS and jQuery though I don't really know how to
          implement them yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've been learning React and Svelte for frontend but I haven't
          implemented node.js yet (fun for me when I'll have to remake this blog
          100 times before I figure out how to actually make functioning blog).
        </li>
        <li>
          I know how to use npm and create a project, though I don't know how
          the filesystem works or how to deploy anything
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        P.S. I don't know anything really about backend but I'm willing to
        figure it out.
